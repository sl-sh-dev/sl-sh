Option | Description
-------|-----------
:read | Open file for reading, this is the default.
:write | Open file for writing.
:append | Open file for writing and append new data to end.
:truncate | Open file for write and delete all existing data.
:create | Create the file if it does not exist and open for writing.
:create-new | Create if does not exist, error if it does and open for writing.
:on-error-nil | If open has an error then return nil instead of producing an error.

Notes on closing.  Files will close when they go out of scope.  Using close will
cause a reference to a file to be marked close (removes that reference).  If
there are more then one references to a file it will not actually close until
all are released.  Close will also flush the file even if it is not the final
reference.  If a reference to a file is captured in a closure that can also keep
it open (closures currently capture the entire scope not just used symbols).")
