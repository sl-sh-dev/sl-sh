# Welcome

This is a real shell and scripting language that at least two people really
use each day. They really use it on the CLI and they really use it to write
scripts because they want to use a real language in the terminal and they want
that same language to be available for scripting. There's one huge and
wonderful catch, it's a lisp!

# As a shell
As a shell slosh does not differ much from bash at all. It supports pipes,
redirects, ... etc.  You could replace your grandmother's shell with slosh and
as long as you ported her prompt verbatim she probably would not notice.


# As a language
Slosh is inspired by clojure and scheme. It is a type 1 lisp.


# Motication

Lisp is a truly novel family of languages. Every year new developers
discover [what many people have discovered long before
them](https://xkcd.com/297/).

Some of them go on to realize that using a lisp regularly in the terminal could
not only enhance their skills as a developer but potentially open them up to a
whole world of automation and fun by interacting with software that sparks joy.
This could result in a renaissance of custom functionality spread lovingly throughout
their systems. Despite its portability, we do not believe we should write any
more bash code because it has never, and will never, result in "library" code;
it's been decades! This means everything you do with it is a dead-end. There 
is no momentum, and no standing on the shoulders of those that came before you.
Over time, we hope to change that.

The docs are heavily under development as we transition from our old legacy
tree based interpreter (sl-sh) to the register based virtual machine
implementation of the language (slosh).
