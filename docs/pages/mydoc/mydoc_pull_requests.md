sl-sh welcomes pull requests via GitHub: fixing bugs, adding features,
enhancing builtins, adding to the standard library, or anything else.

## Contributing Rust code

*  all submitted rust code must pass the rust fmt and clippy checks, it is
built in to the CI. see `.github/workflows/rust.yml` for reference.
```
cargo fmt
cargo clippy
```

## Contributing sl-sh code

*  all sl-sh code must be documented. The CI automatically runs sl-sh tests.
Therefore, all new sl-sh functions must include a docstring that has an 
`Example: ` section with a sufficient number of test cases (the test library
is made available automatically in this section) to verify correctness.
